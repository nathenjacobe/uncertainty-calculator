# uncertainty-calculator
you can access this on the web [here](https://nathenjacobe.github.io/uncertainty-calculator/)
do NOT use firefox if you are going to use the web version; it is unstable for some reason. Chrome seems to work half the time - good enough.

if it doesn't work on the web, you'll have to use the standalone.

working out uncertainties for everything was boring so why do that when you can make a computer do it for you :)

anyway, it tells you how to use it so just follow those instructions

list of things to be implemented:
- column headers that let you apply x10^s and uncertainties to all values in that column
- implement exponentiation and logs
- other general column / row specific functions like st. dev. and mean
- make the code more readable

at this point im just reinventing excel
