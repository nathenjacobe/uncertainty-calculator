# uncertainty-calculator
you can access this on the web [here](https://nathenjacobe.github.io/uncertainty-calculator/)
as of 20/12/24, Firefox is now supported. if you encounter an error, reload (ctrl + r) to restart the program.

if it doesn't work on the web for any reason, you'll have to use the standalone.

working out uncertainties for everything was boring so why do that when you can make a computer do it for you :)

anyway, it tells you how to use it so just follow those instructions

list of things to be implemented:
- column headers that let you apply x10^s and uncertainties to all values in that column
- implement exponentiation and logs
- other general column / row specific functions like st. dev. and mean
- make the code more readable

this is a slightly worse version of excel
