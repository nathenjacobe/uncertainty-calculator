# uncertainty-calculator

for a web demo, see [here](https://hub.binder.curvenote.dev/user/nathenjacobe-un-inty-calculator-wbjstfji/lab): 

working out uncertainties for everything was boring so why do that when you can make a computer do it for you :)

anyway, it tells you how to use it so just follow those instructions

list of things to be implemented:
- column headers that let you apply x10^s and uncertainties to all values in that column
- implement exponentiation and logs
- other general column / row specific functions like st. dev. and mean
- make the code more readable

at this point im just reinventing excel.
